# Iniparser 4 #

Changes in March 2024:
@lmoellendorf is taking over maintenance for this project. The objective is to get all known issues fixed and released as v4.2.
After that, this project will be frozen here as v4.2 and development should continue as v5, probably on gitlab. Pointers will be updated then.

Thanks a million times to Lars for his tremendous work and help in keeping this library alive!


## I - Overview

This modules offers parsing of ini files from C.
See the complete documentation in HTML format: from this directory,
open the file `html/index.html` with any HTML-capable browser.

Key features:

 - Small : around 1500 sloc inside 4 files (2 .c and 2 .h)
 - Portable : no dependancies, written in `-ansi -pedantic` C89
 - Fully re-entrant : easy to make it thread-safe (just surround
   library calls by mutex)

## II - Building project

A simple `make` at the root of the project should be enough to get the static
(i.e. `libiniparser.a`) and shared (i.e. `libiniparser.so.0`) libraries compiled.

You should consider trying the following rules too :


 - `make check` : run unit tests
 - `make example` : compile the example, run it with `./example/iniexample`

For installation and packaging see [iniparser-meta](https://gitlab.com/iniparser/iniparser-meta).
