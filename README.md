 - Portable : no dependencies, written in `-ansi -pedantic` C89
 - Easy to make it thread-safe, just surround library calls by a mutex.

## II - Building project

A simple `make` at the root of the project should be enough to get the static
(i.e. `libiniparser.a`) and shared (i.e. `libiniparser.so.0`) libraries compiled.

You should consider trying the following rules too :

 - `make check` : run unit tests
 - `make example` : compile the example, run it with `./example/iniexample`
